# Cards against science

Scientists need to have some fun every now and then. Take a jab at science with this game and have a good time with your colleagues (but don't you ever party with non-sciencey people?). See [here](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/) for what Cards against humanity actually is (if you don't know already).

**Updated 9/28/18** by postdocs and graduate students in bioinformatics and complex trait genetics at [UCSF](https://bioinformatics.ucsf.edu/). Collaborative google doc can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BYh7PoW5e2HLYHgxcC-_V6F7evLkC80f6KZ1_7PU32c/edit?usp=sharing)

# Guidelines

1. Use 6 underscores for the blanks (______) for consistency.

2. Use HTML codes to stylize your cards, but limit yourself to:
	* `<b></b>` **Bold text**. 
	* `<i></i>` *Italic text*.
	* `<u></u>` <u>Underlined text.</u>
	* `<strikethrough></strikethrough>` ~~Strike-through text~~.
	* `<sub></sub>` <sub>Subscript text.</sub>
	* `<sup></sup>` <sup>Superscript text.<sup>

3. Regenerate the cards with [Bigger Blacker Cards](http://biggerblackercards.com/). Current PDFs of cards can be found in `/card_pdfs`

4. Keep the ratio of black to white cards at 1:5, that way the game stays playable for 5 people at the bare minimum (pro-tip: use `wc -l black-cards.txt` and divide the number of lines by two to get the number of black cards, same for white).

5. Try to avoid redundant entries. 

6. Add a whiteline between cards.
